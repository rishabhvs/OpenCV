# Virtual Painting - OpenCV MiniProject.
## By Rishabh Shah 1914118 , Naman Shah 1914117 and Rohit Mane 1912056

Using the various opencv and numpy modules,this program "Finger Painting" was implemented. We use the **cv2.videoCapture()** to use the laptop's video camera to take continuos input frames.Then we setup a 5x5 kernel using **numpy.ones()** function.Next we initialise the draw area and the co-ordinates.Now an infinite while loop is setup. The frames are now continuously being read. Using the **cv2.flip** function we flip the frames about y axis. We now change the colour space of the frame to HSV from BGR using the **cv2.cvtColor** function. Next we initialise the upper and lower bounds for the hsv colour to be detected. The **cv2.inRange()** is used the set the limits. Next the erode operation followed by the dilate operation is performed. Doing this allows to reduce or remove noise to a considerable extent. Then the **cv2.findContours** function is used,next we choose the largest contour. Using the **cv2.boundingRect()** function followed by **cv2.rectangle()** to draw an approximate rectangle to highlight the region of interest after obtaining contours from an image. We obtain the left corner co-ordinates of the rectangle to draw. Using the **cv2.line()** function draw a line between the previous points and new points. Now we use the **cv2.add()** function to merge or overlap the video frame and draw area,making it appear like drawing in air. We then use the **numpy.hstack()** function  to put the two outputs next to each other under the same window,and finally using **cv2.imshow()** the main draw window is shown. To clear the draw area  we use the **"c" key** and the **"esc" key** to quit the execution,we use the **cv2.waitkey()** function.
